# arweave-web-archive

Reading content on the web can sometimes be a noisy experience, with a lot of distractions around the parts you actually want to read.

There are already some tools provided by browsers, services and code libraries to extract the important content from web pages and strip out the unnecessary parts, but not everyone uses them and they are not always available.

It's time to archive some content on the Web in a readable, permanent and shareable way.

The goal of this project is to build a service that is easy for users to paste a URL into and get back a shareable link that has only the article, blog post, or other primary content in a clean and pleasant format, with the unnecessary parts removed.
